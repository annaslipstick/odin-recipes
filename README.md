# odin-recipes
This project will showcase what I've learnt thus far in The Odin Project.
tags such as <img> <a> <p> <h1-6>. I am considering to actually collect my recpies on a server I later host (or this gitpage) to access my recpies whenever and wherever I need them.
I'll over time add JS/CSS to the project, but thus far I am just showcasing my current skillevel. However low it may be.
